# Review Roulette Prototype

This project is a simple functional prototype built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), created as part of an evaluation test for long-term collaboration.  

The prototype demonstrates a clean user flow:
1. A landing page where the user leaves a review (simple text input).
2. After submitting, the user gains access to a roulette wheel.
3. The roulette randomly displays **"Win"** or **"Lose"**.

Design perfection is not the goal — the focus is on **logic, structure, user flow, and clean code**.
